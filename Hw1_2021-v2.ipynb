    "\n",
    "You are newly recruited as a Data Scientist at a leading consultancy company in Gothenburg. Your first task at the job is to help the Swedish Public Health Agency (folkhalsomyndigheten) for predicting the diabetes progression of patients. Assume that you are given a dataset D of $n$ patients with $D = \\{ (\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ where $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ represents numerical features of each patients and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ represent the numerical diabetes progression.  One can also view the dataset D as a pair of matrices $(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y})$ with $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fresh with the lectures in the machine learning course at Chalmers, you would like to use a linear model to quickly perform the task. In order words, you would like to find a vector $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times 1}$  such that $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}$.  However,  you have just read one of the most popular machine learning book and it argues that standard linear regression (for finding $\\mathbf{w}$) can lead to various problems such as non-uniqueness of the solution,  overfitting, etc. As a result, you decided to add a penalty term called regularization to control the optimisation problem. More specifically, you want to solve for: $\\min_{\\mathbf{w}}  \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ where  $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\right) + \\left(\\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j^2 \\right) $ with $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ a small coefficient that you will decide later on.\n",

Recall that in the lectures we had a dataset $\\{ (\\mathbf{x}_n, t_n)\\}_{n=1}^N$ where $\\mathbf{x}_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ and $t_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We also appended $1$ to the begining of $\\mathbf{x}_n$ so both $\\mathbf{x}_n$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ were in $\\mathbb{R}^{D+1}$. Thus, here $p$ is the same thing as $D+1$. Compare $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_p$ with $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_D$.\n",
